# Market Simulation

The Market program is a simple cashier application that allows cashiers to calculate sales and profits for different food items in a market.

## Features

- Supports the sale of four food items: Salad, Hamburger, Pizza, and Dessert.
- Calculates and keeps track of total sales, total profit, salad profit, and dessert sales.
- Allows cashiers to input the food code and price for each item sold.
- Provides a receipt displaying the total sales, total profit, salad profit, and dessert sales.

## Usage

To run the Market program, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Compile and run the `Market.java` file using a Java compiler.
3. The program will prompt you to enter the name of the cashier. If no name is provided, a default name will be used.
4. The program will then ask for food codes and prices for the items sold by the cashier.
5. Enter the food code (1 for Salad, 2 for Hamburger, 3 for Pizza, 4 for Dessert) and the corresponding price for each item.
6. To finish entering items and generate a receipt, enter 5 when prompted.
